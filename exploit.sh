# Script will launch ncat to listen on port 4444
# Then, runs exploit code against the Struts2 server to create a reverse shell
# Finally, goes to the ncat screen so that you have control of the server
#
# Sleeps are there to fix an unknown timing issue -- without them
# the shell didn't connect and I got tired of
# trying to debug it.
